Write the following function:

Write a function called getChange that will calculate the number of each 
type of coins (toonies, loonies, quarters, dimes, nickels) necessary to 
make up an amount of money.  Given that we no longer have pennies in 
Canada, we should apply the new rules of change giving where the value is 
rounded down to the nearest 5 cent if the amt ends in a 1, 2, 6 or 7.  It 
is rounded up if it ends in 3,4,8 or 9.
